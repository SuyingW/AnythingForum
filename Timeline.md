# Timeline

A feature with a team memberâ€™s name is to be completed by that person only, from the frontend to the backend and the SQL query. The other features / tasks are to be completed together as a team.

For milestone 4, we need to have the following things in our application, and team members are responsible for (1) making sure the query / feature is correct and complete, (2) include the query / feature in the submission document with all required elements as outlined in the milestone 4 rubric, (3) demoing the query / feature on the demo day:

Queries: INSERT Operation (Diana)

Queries: Projection (Suying)

Queries: Join (William)
